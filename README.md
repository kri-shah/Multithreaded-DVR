Projects I completed from UCONN CSE 3100, and on my own. Projects completed in C. 
Project Description:

bellman_(honors_proj) - For this honors project, I constructed a Distance Vector Routing (DVR) Protocol based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm, a "shortest path" approach for navigating networks of routers. This protocol dynamically adjusts to changing costs between nodes, simulating real-world scenarios where routers might encounter damage or updates. Project is a simulation of 5 routers, utilizing mutexes and multithreading.
